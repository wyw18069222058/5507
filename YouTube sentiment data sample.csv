"Now I am craving Chengdu Noodles! Thanks for this great video, love your energy and videos!"
"Nice video but I beg to differ, personally i found chongqing noodle is much better than chengdue?¡è¡ê!! And even better noodles are in northwestern region, such as Lanzhou."
"hey guys, this is the most fun video in youtube i've seen in the past a few months. love it, keep up your good work"
Good stuff!!!

"best city of noodles is Lanzhou, hope you can try it!"
"the ""PUGAI"" noodles place's chiaken or non-spicy ""ZAJIANG"" are actually the best, it might be the fact that they were selected to michellin guide of Chengdu, the non-spicy local noodles  might be the only factor to say if the place is really good or not for the locals who really understand the shit"
